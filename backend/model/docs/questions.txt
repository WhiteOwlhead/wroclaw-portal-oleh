	I reside in Poland under a visa given for my full-time studies. I want to apply for a permit for temporary residence for this purpose. May I work in Poland during the term of validity of the visa and the permit? Will that be possible while I will be waiting for the permit?
If your stay is based on the Polish visa given for your studies (art. 60(1)(9) of the Law on Foreign Nationals) or on a permit for temporary residence (art. 144(1) of the Law on Foreign Nationals), you may work without a work permit, also while waiting for the permit for temporary residence for your studies (given in the form of a stamp), provided that you have applied for the permit during your stay under the visa and your application was correct and complete (or rectified on time if there were any formal gaps). See art. 87(1)(12)(b) of the Law on the Promotion of Employment and on the Labor Market in connection with art. 108(1)(2) of the Law on Foreign Nationals.

	Can I obtain the information whether my document is ready to be collected or about formal irregularities in my application for issuance of exchange of the document by phone?
No, in such cases, in accordance with a valid Regulation concerning personal data, employees of the Office may not provide by phone the information concerning the given person. In order to obtain such information it is necessary to come in person or send a letter via post.

	On what basis may a for-eign national enter Poland legally? How to prolong the permit for residence?
A foreign (“third-country”) national may enter, and stay in, Poland either based on a valid Polish or Schengen visa or under the visa-exempt traffic system (unless the visa is required anyway).

Also, the entry may be based on a permit for residence or a long-term visa granted by another Schengen Area Member State.

If this person wishes to stay longer than provided for in the instrument of entry (up to 3 months, as to the rule), this should be legalized by applying for an extension. The application should state its reasons and the term of stay may be extended by an administrative decision given based on the Law on Foreign Nationals and its implementing regulations. The application should be filed on a special form with the Province Governor with jurisdiction over the place of stay.

The extension can be temporary (up to 3 years for the holder of a permit for temporary residence) or indefinite (for the holder of a permit for permanent residence or a permit for residence of a long-term EU resident). The extension is given in the form of a residence card.

	I reside in Poland based on a Polish visa reflecting the purpose of my stay. The visa will remain valid for 10 more months. Do I have to apply for a permit for tem-porary residence?
No. The Law on Foreign Nationals allows for granting, but does not require, a permit for the temporary residence of a foreign national who intends to stay in Poland longer than 3 months. The stay may be based on a sequence of visas or on the visa-exempt traffic system, subject to compliance with the requirements for the entry to, and residence in, Poland.

Within what time should I leave Poland if I am refused a permit for residence?
Without delay, within up to 30 days from the effective date of the Province Governor’s decision or from the date of serving on you the decision of the Head of the Office for Foreigners (after the appellate procedure). The decision may:
–    Refuse to extend your Schengen or Polish visa;

–    Refuse to grant you a permit for temporary residence;

–    Refuse to grant you a permit for permanent residence;

–    Refuse to grant you permit for residence of a long-term EU resident; or

–    Terminate proceedings in any of these cases.


	I have graduated from a Polish university and I am seeking employment. What can be term / validity of my permit for temporary residence?
A permit for temporary residence for this purpose is granted only once, for 9 months.


	Which part of the city is the most popular?
„Our clients, especially young people, are particularly keen to seek flats along Wroclaw's main transportation routes. They seek housing in the following areas: ul Powstańców Śląskich, Legnicka, Grabiszyńska and in the city centre. They find it particularly important to be able to travel freely and access other parts of the city by bus or tram.

	How much does it cost to rent a studio or one bedroom flat, What are the additional costs?
„Wroclaw is extremely varied when it comes to the prices of flats.. The price primarily depends on the location of the property and the type of housing, that is, whether you are dealing with a tenement or a newly developed building. The standard determines the price. Roughly speaking, in order to buy a studio you need to spend 150 thousand PLN for a flat in the suburbs and 220 thousand PLN and more in a newly developed building in the city centre. As for one bedroom flats, the prices range from 175 thousand PLN for smallest flats (ca. 33 sqm) in the market to 350 thousand PLN for larger flats or in newly developed buildings in the city centre. These prices are for your information only, as you can come across real bargains or more expensive luxury apartments. The buyer incurs the costs of the transaction. The commission is usually several per cent of the price depending on the type of the property.

	How many foreign nationals rent flats in Wroclaw?
„A growing number of foreign nationals are looking for a flat in Wroclaw. If you seek to let your flat to a foreign professional, it is important that your property reaches a certain standard.”

	Is there any general standard or the offers may vary?
„Unfortunately, there is no accepted standard both visually (furnishings, decoration, etc.) and legally, that is, in the agreements to be signed by the lessee. It goes without saying that a higher standard is provided by those who have several flats on offer or by professional agencies.”

	What do you need to focus on or remember while looking for a flat?
„One key thing apart from the price is whether you like the flat, there are no ownership issues and the agreement is clear. I know from my own experience that the more detailed the agreement is the fewer problems are going to come up in the future. So it is worth meeting the owner to discuss all the points that you find vague or suggest points that you find important and are missing in the agreement. Should you have any doubts, please remember that it is always the best solutions to discuss.”

	Looking for a flat: on your own or through agency?
So, it is worth finding a flat before you arrive in Poland. You will spare a few stressful moments both to yourself and your family. However, looking for a flat on your own (especially if you are yet to arrive) may turn out to be quite difficult, which is why it worth using the services of professional real estate agencies. A lot of ads are available on the Internet free of charge. You may also want to join special groups at social networking sites such as Facebook, as the owners often use them to post their ads directly, without any intermediaries. You should bear in mind that real estate agencies usually charge commission for their services that is tantamount to half or one month's rent. That being said, real estate agencies can provide you with a safety net. Whenever there is a dispute between a landlord and a tenant, the agency may step in to resolve the issue.

What to focus on when signing a lease agreement:
If the lessee intends to rent an apartment for a larger group of people or is expecting his or her family to arrive any time soon and join them for a longer period of time, the names of all the tenants with their passport numbers should be added to the lease agreement. This is required for your family to obtain a temporary residence permit.
Additionally, foreign nationals who apply for a residence permit are also required to provide their proof of address, e.g. their current lease/purchase agreement and the document that shows they are residing in Poland legally make them eligible for a temporary residence card, which in turn is prerequisite to obtaining a residence permit.

========================================================================================================

	Can foreigners coming to Poland use the services of the public health care? And if not in the public institutions, are there private health care facilities where foreigners can find assistance in case of sickness? For answers to these questions, scroll down. With foreign residents of Wroclaw in mind, we brought together some general principles of health care in Poland.

 
In the context of taking up work, one of the required documents is the proof of valid travel medical insurance in the amount of at least EUR 30 000 or, for example, a proof of payment of health insurance with the NFZ (National Health Fund, which is a state institution that finances health care services from contributions paid by the person insured in the Fund). Does this mean that a foreigner who intends to work in Poland must always have a valid travel insurance with them at all times? No, this is not necessary.

To use health care services free of charge, you must be insured in the National Health Fund. On the other hand, all persons employed in Poland, including foreigners, are subject to mandatory health insurance, which means that a contribution to the National Health Fund is "automatically" discharged from their monthly salary (usually it's done by the employer). Then, you should sign up with a local clinic of your choice that would provide the required medical services for you. When registering, it is worth remembering that members of the insured person's immediate family can also use the medical services available to the payer, if they have no other proof of insurance (such information should be reported when choosing a NFZ medical facility).

And what if you don't have medical insurance
Foreigners residing legally in Poland, who are not included in the compulsory health insurance should consider the option of voluntary insurance with the National Health Fund, to avoid paying the full cost of treatment in case of sudden illness or accident. To do this, please apply to one of the branches of the NFZ near your place of residence. In order to sign a contract with the NFZ, foreigners from outside the EU should also have one of the following documents, in addition to a passport:

a visa in order to work;
a temporary residence permit;
a permanent residence permit;
an EU resident long-term permit ;
authorisation to stay for humanitarian reasons;
a permit for tolerated stay under the refugee procedure;
a proof of refugee status granted in Poland, or using a temporary protection on its territory.
After signing a contract with the NFZ, go to a branch or inspectorate of the Social Insurance Institution (ZUS), to submit a form ZUS ZZA, which you can print and deliver personally, or send by mail to a ZUS branch or inspectorate in your district.

Detailed information regarding medical care can also be found on-line here.
In Poland, you can also use private medical services, but in this case, all the benefits paid, obviously. In Wroclaw, there are many private medical facilities providing a wide range of services - you can easily find them using a search engine. Many employees of Wroclaw companies, especially in the service sector, use these.

'I believe all companies that have so far invested in Wroclaw, or at least a vast majority of them, offer their employees benefit packages including private medical care. Depending on the employer, and a person's position or function held in the company, these packages include a wider or narrower range of services,' says Aleksandra Drozd Kłonowska with the Wrocław Agglomeration Development Agency. 'Several years ago, we conducted a survey among employees of the companies in the Wroclaw service sector that employ foreigners. In it, we surveyed, among others, the employees' experience related to the use of public health services. Most respondents indicated that, mainly due to the long waiting times for consultations with the selected specialists, they use only the private medical care. There were also opinions that doctors in public institutions are competent and knowledgeable, and the 112 emergency medical assistance is comprehensive and professional,' she adds.

====================================================================================
	Persons who are not citizens of a EU/EFTA member state may sign for compulsory or voluntary health insurance in the National Health Fund on the basis of the following documents:

a visa for the purpose of performing work activities,
a temporary residence permit, excluding a temporary residence permit due to circumstances requiring short-term stay,
a permanent residence permit,
a residence permit for a long-term resident of the European Communities,
a residence permit granted for humanitarian reasons
a permit for tolerated stay;
this right is also available to persons who have been granted refugee status in the Republic of Poland or subsidiary protection or persons eligible for temporary protection.
Voluntary health insurance in the National Health Fund may cover persons not being citizens of a EU/EFTA member state who are:

Students and participants in PhD studies studying in Poland and graduates serving a compulsory internship in Poland,
members of religious orders and alumni of clerical and theological seminaries, postulants, novices, and junior monks of religious orders or their equivalents who reside in Poland on the basis of the aforementioned documents,
persons serving an adaptational internship (an internship for foreigners applying for the right to practise the profession of a nurse/midwife),
persons attending Polish language courses and preparatory courses for studying that are referred to in higher education laws (courses for foreigners).
Family member being a foreigner
A family member signed for health insurance may also be a foreigner. However, he/she must be a foreigner residing in the territory of Poland and in the territory of an European Union member state or a EFTA member state. However, such a person may be signed for health insurance only when this person is not entitled to obtain health benefits in Poland pursuant to EU provisions relating to the co-ordination of social security systems.

	How much does voluntary medical insurance in the National Health Fund cost?
The monthly premium always amounts to 9% of average remuneration in the enterprise sector along with profit-sharing payments. Information about the amount of average remuneration is published every quarter by the Central Statistical Office (GUS). The average amount of remuneration in the 2nd quarter of 2018 was 4,521.08 PLN.

If we decide on voluntary medical insurance and we have irregularly paid premiums so far or had a break in the insurance period, we may have to pay an additional fee in the amount depending on the length of the break:

from 3 months to 1 year – 20% of income assumed as a premium assessment base,
above 1 year to 2 years – 50% of income assumed as a premium assessment base,
above 2 years to 5 years – 100% of income assumed as a premium assessment base,
above 5 years to 10 years – 150% of income assumed as a premium assessment base,
above 10 years – 200% of income assumed as a premium assessment base.
In special justified cases, the head of the relevant branch of the National Health Fund may exempt us from the fee or split it into favourable instalments. Many persons also try to bypass these fees by signing a contract of specific work from which the premium is paid and then by deciding on voluntary insurance. The penalty is counted from the last break in the payment of premiums. The good news is that we may deduct health insurance premiums from tax (as persons employed on a full-time basis), so a large part of money will return to our wallet. To put it more precisely, we may deduct as much as 7.75% of the premium assessment base in the tax return (the entire amount of health insurance premium is 9%). However, we must remember to retain premium payment proofs – this is our obligation.

	How to arrange voluntary insurance? How much does the health insurance premium cost? 
You just need to visit your branch office of the National Health Fund (NFZ) with a filled-in application (download here), an identity document and a document confirming the last insurance period (their detailed list can be found here). After submitting the application and paying the fee (if any), you will sign a contract. Then you have to visit the relevant branch of the Social Insurance Company (ZUS) and submit a filled-in ZUS ZZA form there within 7 days. Then you will have to pay the due premium to ZUS’s account and to submit a ZUS DRA statement to ZUS’s branch office by the 15th day of each month. If you decide to terminate the contract, you also do so in writing in NFZ’s branch office.

Remember that, when entering into a contract, you are obliged to report all members of your family who are not covered by the insurance policy in any other respect. You will not pay any extra fee for this.

Employment contract and contract of specific work – insurance premium to be paid by the employer

For persons employed under an employment contract, the health insurance premium amounting to 9% of earnings is paid by the employer on our behalf. The same goes for a contract of specific work – this type of co-operation entitles us to use NFZ’s benefits, too.

The employer paying the NFZ insurance premium for us is certainly the most convenient option – we do not have to remember about premiums or transfer payments by ourselves. We can check whether premiums are duly paid by means of the eWUŚ system.

Work without a full-time job – the lack of entitlement to NFZ
If you happen to lose a full-time job and you cannot hope for a contract of specific work, you lose the right to services offered by public health care units. What to do in such a situation? How to recover insurance in NFZ? You can do it in a few ways.

Private medical care is not everything
Indeed, the purchase of a private policy is as simple as ever – we can sign for the programme along with a member of our family (e.g., our husband employed in a large corporation or even our partner, because private medical insurance companies offer their services not only to families) by paying a few dozen zlotys per month.

It is worth remembering that private medical care will ensure access to specialist doctors and potentially also medical diagnostic services. But what if we are suddenly hospitalised, break our leg while skiing or participate in a motor accident? In such cases, we have to pay for all hospital services from our own pocket. And these are large amounts – cutting out a vermiform appendix costs minimum 4,000 PLN, an urgent broken leg operation costs almost 5,000 PLN, and a life-saving operation after a heart attack may cost up to 20,000 PLN.

The lack of a full-time job – how to take out private insurance in NFZ?
There are a few alternatives to become covered by insurance once again:

you may register your own business activity,
you may remain a freelancer and take out voluntary insurance in NFZ,
in certain situations, you may use the insurance policy of a member of the nearest family. You may be covered by the insurance of your spouse, parents or grandparents, provided that you reside in a common household.
Individual business activity – how much does the NFZ insurance premium cost?
As a sole trader, you have to pay the social insurance premium by yourself – HERE you will check the amount of the premium for the year 2018. Those who register their first business activity are allowed to pay the discount premium of approx. 460 PLN per month, but this option is available only for the first two years. One of the elements of this amount is health insurance, which allows the insured to use NFZ’s services.

AnchorFor a person making their first steps in the business world and only starting to build his/her network of business partners, these costs usually prove too high. It is mainly because of these costs that the person is often uninsured for months and years.

A little something for cinema-goers
For many foreigners staying in Wroclaw for longer, one of the most popular pastimes is going to the cinema or theatre. The needs of foreign enthusiasts of good cinema were catered to by Kino Nowe Horyzonty at ul. Kazimierza Wielkiego. This is where special screenings take place, as part of the cycle "Polish Cinema for beginners." It is a series of encounters with the most interesting works of Polish cinema, dedicated primarily to foreigners. All films are shown with English subtitles, and are preceded by a lecture by an expert of the film world, who introduces the subject and the socio-historical context of the presented work. The screening is followed by a discussion. The language of the event is English. A detailed repertoire is available here.

In summer, Kino Nowe Horyzonty hosts the T-Mobile New Horizons Festival, known not only in the country, but also abroad, in which all films have English translation. Also, the language of both meetings with artists and information materials is English.

Spotlight on theatre
Also theatre-goers will find something for themselves. In this case, they can certainly count on the Polski Theatre at ul.

Forma Płynna Beach Bar, Wybrzeże Wyspiańskiego
Instead of sand, you will find the neat green grass here. Instead of umbrellas and sunshades, you will see crowns of mini-forest trees. Right on the bank of the Oder, a climatic city beach called Forma Płynna [Liquid Form] has been established; it neighbours on the boulevard of the Wroclaw University of Technology through the fence.

The climate of this place is created by trees and by hammocks and deckchairs suspended between them. On hot summer days, it is an optimal place for a lazy afternoon with friends. “Chill, relax, jazz”, we can read in Internet opinions of thrilled visitors of the new Oder beach in the city centre.

Przestrzeń: park, pizza and chillout, ul. Mickiewicza/Paderewskiego
Away from the Oder, you can also find suitable places to rest during a good weather. “Przestrzeń is an idea to relax away from the tourist pubs, noise and prices of the Wroclaw Market Square,” encourage the hosts of an open-air diner at Sępolno. At the junction of Mickiewicza and Paderewskiego streets, the atmospheric spot has started another summer season.

There were many changes in infrastructure during winter. The large container was designed as a cosy diner that contains not only a bar, but also a kitchen and a pizza oven.

In the shadow of old oaks, guests relax on deckchairs and comfortable garden furniture. Children have a big sandbox and a small playground at their disposal, and adults can taste beer, cider and fine coffee. It is also possible to play chess and badminton or read the current press.

Przestrzeń [Space] attracts a colourful and cheerful company, families with children, and lovers of good music and ambitious cinema. The open-air cinema shows documentaries every Wednesday and world cinema masterpieces every Sunday. On weekends, musicians from Wroclaw and other places play together on the stage of Przestrzeń.
Przestrzeń is open every day from 3:00 p.m. till 10:00 p.m. (Monday – Friday) and from 3:00 p.m. till 11:59 p.m. (Saturday – Sunday).

Beach on Politechnika Boulevard, Wybrzeże Wyspiańskiego
Sun lovers can also visit a cosy beach on the Promenade of the Wroclaw University of Technology at Wybrzeże Wyspiańskiego. If you love recreation by the water, you have a beach and sandy volleyball and badminton fields at your disposal.

Unlike on other city beaches, there is no bar or toilets here.

Prosto z Mostu Beach Bar
Wroclaw inhabitants can also enjoy the charm of another beach that has recently been created close to the Warszawskie Bridges: Prosto z Mostu [Straight from the Bridge] Beach Bar. It occupies as many as 5,000 m2 of space intended for relax, where various events (e.g., volleyball games, pub quizzes or film shows) are organised very frequently.
