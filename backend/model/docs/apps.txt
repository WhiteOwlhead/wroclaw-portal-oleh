When living in Wroclaw, there are a couple of applications which make your life in Wroclaw much easier, most of our friends have these apps installed on their phones, so we quickly recommend them to you:

Jakdojade is a perfect application for getting around with public transport in Wroclaw. It has the latest schedules, makes it easy to navigate from A to B and most of the times even real time information from busses and trams. You can also buy your ticket with jakdojade.

With Koleo application you are able to purchase train tickets online. 

Embargo is an application you can use to collect loyalty points in many venues in Wroclaw, not only cafés but also restaurants and more.
Otodom
Looking for an apartment to rent, or you consider even buying some real estate in Wroclaw? Otodom is one of the most popular portals where plenty of real estate is listed to rent and buy. 

You want to buy or sell something in your neighbourhood? OLX is sort of the Polish version of local eBay listings. On OLX you can find apartments for rent, clothes, cars, pretty much everything.
To order food in Wroclaw to your home, there are plenty of options like Uber Eats, Wolt, Glovo, but we would mostly recommend Pyszne to you.

We recommend you DEEPL as a good translation app in case you do not speak Polish yet – in our experience DEEPL provides much better results than Google Translate when it comes to Polish, keep that in mind.

Urbancard will allow you to buy tram and bus tickets, however it is also possible to buy them contactless in the tram/bus. 

If you don‘t have your own bike, join the City Bike rental system in Wroclaw with the WRM application.
