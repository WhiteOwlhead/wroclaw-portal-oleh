Well, let us proceed with another challenge – finding a flat in Wroclaw! The cost for renting has gone up quite a bit in the past years and it is probably fair to say that the cost of renting an apartment in Wroclaw is cost wise on the same level like in other large cities in Western Europe, so say goodbye to the times where Poland was considered to be a country with low cost of living… (By the way, here we have more information about cost of living in Wroclaw).

Here are our recommendations on where to find a flat, room or apartment in Wroclaw as foreigner:

OTODOM – is probably the largest portal with rooms and apartments offered for rent and to buy
OLX – originally for buy/sell announcements, but you can find a lot of flats on it too

If you speak Polish, this is the largest group to rent flats and rooms in Wroclaw: WROCŁAW NA WYNAJEM – mieszkania, pokoje.
General hint: Never, ever pay anything upfront before seeing the place. We also received word that you better look for private offers as some of the real estate agencies might surprise you with quite some hidden fees.
